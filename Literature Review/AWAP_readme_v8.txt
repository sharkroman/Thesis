1) DATA CUSTODIAN
--------------------------------------------------------

CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research is the custodian of this dataset.

This dataset has been developed by the Australian Water Availability Project
(AWAP) Team, CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR).  The original
meteorological data were supplied by the Bureau of Meteorology Australia (BoM).
Project management was undertaken by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS) in the
Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF).

Funding for CSIRO AWAP science projects and the maintenance and development of
CSIRO AWAP data is provided by the South Eastern Australian Climate Initiative
(SEACI), a three year, $7.5 million research program investigating the causes
and impacts of climate change and climate variability across south eastern
Australia.  SEACI is a collaboration between the Murray-Darling Basin Authority,
Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment, Department of Climate
Change, Managing Climate Variability Program, CSIRO, and the Bureau of
Meteorology.

5) DATA SOURCE
--------------------------------------------------------

Data are produced by the WaterDyn model, which has been developed by CSIRO
(Raupach et al. 2009, 2008) to model the terrestrial water balance across
continental Australia.  Key inputs and constraints on the model are the
meteorology (solar radiation, precipitation, minimum and maximum daily
temperatures) and continental parameter maps (e.g. albedo, soil characteristics,
seasonality of vegetation greenness).

The meteorological fields are generated by the BoM.  They generate both daily
products (near-real time) and reprocessed products (including quality control
and incorporating data that arrive too late for inclusion in the near-real time
product).  The WaterDyn model is critically dependent on the timely arrival and
accuracy of the meteorological data.  Operational outputs (weekly and monthly
near-real time data) will be delayed if the daily meteorological fields are not
available.

The parameter maps are static for each WaterDyn model version but will be
updated if new information becomes available.  Updates of the parameter maps
will always invoke an update of the model version.  To date there have been no
changes to the parameter maps since the original 2007 release.

The WaterDyn model is always undergoing improvements and testing of new
features.  When these improvements or new parameter maps are deemed significant
a stable version of the WaterDyn model is created and the datasets will be
reprocessed with the latest version of the model.

The available datasets are generally a century-plus series from the beginning
of 1900 to the end of the latest year of the reprocessed meteorological data
(monthly and annual data), and an operational series from the beginning of the
last complete year of reprocessed meteorological data to the present (weekly
and monthly data).


6) DATA INFORMATION

Note that sometimes the website maps are shown with different units than are
used in the data files. This will be addressed in a future release of the data.

Notes:

1. WRel1 and WRel2 give average values for the specified aggregation period
   (weekly, monthly, annual, etc.).  WRel1End and WRel2End give values for
   WRel1 and WRel2 at the end of the aggregation period, which is more useful
   for water balance calculations.
2. The inclusion of open-water evaporation (FWWater) post-dates the AWAP Phase
   III final report and so is documented here: FWWater is Penman evaporation
   with assumed aerodynamic conductance of 0.01 m/s and saturation deficit
   estimated as:
   (Saturation Vapour Pressure at Tmax) - (Saturation Vapour Pressure at Tmin)
   It is a little larger than Priestley-Taylor evaporation.  For each pixel on
   the continent, open-water evaporation is an estimate of the evaporation that
   would occur from a small open water body if there happened to be one at that
   pixel.  "Small" implies that the evaporation doesn't modify the meteorology
   through evaporative cooling etc.  FWWater can be considered a model of pan
   evaporation.


6a) METEOROLOGICAL DATA
--------------------------------------------------------

The meteorological data are provided by the BoM as daily gridded fields.
Rainfall data are available for 1900 to present, temperatures from 1911 to
present and solar irradiance from 1990 to present.

The rainfall and temperature data come from the BoM's network of rain gauges
and weather stations. The solar irradiance data are obtained using satellite
imagery from geostationary meteorological satellites.

Starting with the January 2011 release, AWAP historical runs use the BoM
Version 3 Recalibrated Rainfall product.  This product is generated by
rescaling daily rainfall at the end of each month so that the sum of daily
rainfalls matches the subsequent monthly reanalyses.  The discrepancy between
the sums of original daily rainfalls and the end-of-month reanalyses is due to
differences in the interpolation methods applied to daily and monthly rainfall
because of their different spatial structures.  Interpolation failures in the
original daily data occur in sparsely gauged areas of the continent such as the
Central and Western Deserts.  These are removed in the recalibrated rainfall
product and replaced with missing data values.  For AWAP modelling these areas
are filled (at CSIRO) with the daily average calculated from the corresponding
monthly reanalyses.  Weekly AWAP operational runs continue to use unrecalibrated
original rainfall, which is available in near real time.  These are updated
using recalibrated rainfall where noted.

For historic runs from 1900 to present, missing solar irradiance data in the
BoM weather archive, including the period 1900 to 1989 and any instrument-
related pixel losses after that, are replaced with a monthly radiation
climatology from the period 1990 to 2011.  Missing temperatures for 1900 to 1910
are replaced with a monthly temperature climatology from the nearest
contemporary 30-year period, 1911 to 1940.

Key references for Bureau of Meteorology AWAP data are Jones et al. (2007; 2009)
and Grant et al. (2008) and the information at http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/.


6b) PARAMETER DATA
--------------------------------------------------------

Data and maps of the following spatially explicit parameters are available at
the AWAP website www.csiro.au/awap.

Albedo
------

Mean annual shortwave albedo (surface reflectivity) is used in AWAP as part of
the calculation of available energy during daylight hours.  The data were
supplied by Ian Grant at the Bureau of Meteorology, and are the average of
monthly data for the period 1994-1999 derived from AVHRR.  The original data
were supplied at 0.25 deg resolution and were resampled to 0.05 deg for AWAP
modelling.  The other important surface radiative property, emissivity, is set
to a uniform value of 1.

All-sky shortwave albedo is an average of direct and diffuse albedos appropriate
for clear skies, where the direct albedo is an average appropriate for all solar
zenith angles over a month.  The differences between clear sky and diffuse or
"white-sky" albedos (also calculated) are almost always less than 0.01 (Ian
Grant, Bureau of Meteorology, pers. comm., 17 Sept 2004).  The data are
currently unpublished, but were created using standard methods.  The atmospheric
correction was done as described in Dilley et al. (2000) with the BRDF
dynamically modelled using a method based on that described by Schaaf et al.
(2002) for application to MODIS (Grant, pers. comm., 22 June 2005).

Soil Properties
---------------

Spatially explicit soil properties for two soil layers are defined by maps
obtained from interpretations of the Digital Atlas of Australian Soils.  The
(rasterised) Atlas assigns a dominant soil type to each 0.05 deg grid cell
across the continent, from over 700 possible soil types.  Pedotransfer functions
then assign physical soil properties in upper and lower layers (A and B
horizons) to each soil type.  The properties used for AWAP are saturated
volumetric water content, soil layer thickness.  Saturated hydraulic
conductivities are set to uniform values for the two layers.

Key references for these data are McKenzie and Hook (1992), McKenzie et al.
(2000) and Northcote et al. (1960-1968).

The Digital Atlas of Australian Soils is available from
http://www.daff.gov.au/brs/data-tools/daas-metadata

Vegetation Greenness from SeaWiFs FAPAR
---------------------------------------

FAPAR from SeaWiFS is a derived product available globally at ~0.04 deg spatial
and monthly time resolution (Gobron et al. 2002), continuously from September
1997 to June 2006.  For AWAP the data were resampled to 0.05 deg resolution and
the data from complete years only (1998-2005) were averaged to create a monthly
climatology from which a climatology of vegetation cover fraction was created
for use here.

Spatial Mask of Australia
-------------------------

The WaterDyn model requires a full complement of parameters and meteorology,
and cannot model land areas with missing or unspecified data.  Features that
are not modelled include lakes, salt lakes and salt pans (e.g. South Australia
and coastal NW Western Australia, which are not specified in the soil parameter
data.  Model results should be plotted in conjunction with a standard coastline
definition, such as Geoscience Australia's Geodata Topo 10M
(http://www.ga.gov.au/meta/ANZCW0703005262.html).


6c) PERCENTILE RANKS
-------------------------------------------------------- 

Two types of data are produced for each variable: absolute data and percentile
rank data.  Percentile ranks are designed to make dynamical variability clearer
and show the rank of the data within the cumulative probability distribution
for that month (weekly and monthly outputs), or for all years (annual outputs),
over a standard climatological period, usually 1961 to 1990.  Cumulative
probability distributions and percentile ranks are calculated separately at
each 0.05 deg grid cell.  Because of their high dependence on solar radiation,
percentile ranks for SolarMJ and FWPT are based on a 1990-2011 climatology,
i.e. during the period of satellite operation.


7) DIRECTORY, FILENAME AND DATA FORMATS 
-------------------------------------------------------

The maps are publicly available at http://www.csiro.au/awap.

The data files are available to authorised users only.

The data files are distributed as zip files each containing the model outputs
in physical units and percentile ranks for one quantity for one year.  Zip files
have the generic filename,

    yyyymmdd_YYYYMMDD.var.vv.fmt.zip

where,
    yyyymmdd    First date of the period (inclusive), usually yyyy0101.
    YYYYMMDD    Last date of the period (inclusive), usually YYYY1231.
    var         Variable name, between 4 and 7 characters
                (e.g. PhiE, WRel2, TempMax etc.).
    vv          Version number, generally '00'.
    fmt         File format, either flt (ESRI Float) or nc (NetCDF).

There are two zip files for each quantity/year, one containing the data in ESRI
Float and the other in NetCDF format.

Within each flt.zip file, the data are given in ESRI binary raster format (for
ArcGIS import) including two files, an IEEE floating-point file (.flt) with an
accompanying ASCII header file (.hdr).  The header file contains the information
required to read the float file.  An example header file is:

    ncols          813                # Number of columns
    nrows          670                # Number of rows
    xllcorner    112.9250             # Longitude of lower-left corner
    yllcorner   -43.57500             # Latitude of lower-left corner
    cellsize   5.0000001E-02          # Cell or grid size (degrees)
    nodata_value   -9999.000          # Null value
    byteorder lsbfirst                # Byte order

The generic filename for float and header files is,

    [pcr_]xxx_var_yyyymmdd.(flt,hdr)

where,
    pcr_        Optional prefix that denotes percentile rank data.
    xxx         Time period of the file. This can be
                  'ann' = annual
                  'mth' = monthly
                  'run' = particular to the type of WaterDyn model run,
                          usually weekly or monthly.
    var         Variable name.
    yyyymmdd    Final date of the time period (inclusive).

The same file naming conventions are used for the NetCDF files, except the
suffix is .nc rather than .flt, and there is no header file.  All the metadata
is stored in the NetCDF file as part of the data dimension and coordinate
variables, or else as attributes of the main data variable.  Each NetCDF file
has two global attributes:
  1 :history which provides some key background information and pointers to
             further information (such as this Readme file).
  2 :version which stores the data versioning information (see Sec. 10 below).


8) GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE
-------------------------------------------------------

Data are unprojected, in geographic decimal degrees, referenced to GDA94
(equivalent to WGS84 for all practical purposes).  The data have a spatial
resolution of 0.05 degrees latitude and longitude (~5 km x 5km).  Whole-degrees
cross cell centres.  The grid dimensions are given in the header files that
accompany the float-format data files.  The map images (*.gif) are generated
from the float-format files but are not geo-referenced.

The exact spatial coverage across the continent is determined by the model's
mask, discussed above.


9) DATA QUALITY 
-------------------------------------------------------

The accuracy of the model results is subject to the limitations imposed by the
assumptions and parameterisations inherent in the model, and the limitations of
the parameter data and meteorology, in particular the sparseness of the
sampling networks involved in their creation.  In addition, suitable data for
model comparison are available at only a limited number of sites.  For a
discussion of model testing and accuracy, and full details of the WaterDyn
model, refer to the report Raupach et al. 2009.


10) VERSION NOMENCLATURE
------------------------------------------------------------------

The version of the WaterDyn model and the run number are the major versioning
component of these data.  The relevant model version can always be found in the
top bar of the data series webpage.  Run numbers are given for historical runs,
but not specified for operational runs (which are identified by their date
range).  If you are accessing the data files then the model version
and run number, when specified, will be included in the source directory name.
At present the model version is not included in the data file, zip file nor 
map file names.

The WaterDyn model version number, as given in the top bar of the data series
webpage, is given as,

    WaterDynXXy

where,
    XX    Incremental version number.
    y     Mode of operation where,
              'M' = Forward model without model-data fusion
              'P' = Model-data fusion using PEST
              'K' = Model-data fusion using Kalman Filter
              'G' = Model-data fusion using Genetic Algorithm.

The run number, when specified, is usually of the form,

    RunXXz

where,
    XX    WaterDyn model version number (without the mode identifier).
    z     Denotes a unique run of the model, usually incremental from 'a'.
    
As mentioned in section 7, the zip files do have a version number but this
usually relates to the operational processing of the weekly and monthly data.

  - CSIRO changes
    - Update monthly climatology for gap-filling and synthetic series, now 
      includes data from 1990-2011.

January 2011 - WaterDyn 26M - Run 26c Historical

Summary: 

Run 26c is significantly different from the previous Run 25a (and its
interim update). These differences are entirely due to improvements in the forcing
meteorology supplied by the Bureau of Meteorology, including the use of
recalibrated rainfall for historical modelling. Erroneous percentile ranks for
FWPT and SolarMJ, due to a bug in the post-processing software, have been
corrected.  WaterDyn26M (the model) is the same as WaterDyn25M except for the
addition of new output products and minor fixes and efficiency improvements
that have been tested and found to have no impact on the results.  Input
parameters are also unchanged.

Model Version:

AWAP WaterDyn 26M (changes from 25M, Run 25a):
- Write new outputs WRel1End, WRel2End which are WRel1 and WRel2 at end of
  monthly averaging periods.  WRel1 and WRel2 remain time-averaged over mth,
  ann, or run.
- Calculate open-water evaporation FWWater [m/day] using Penman-Monteith
  equation, with open-water aerodynamic conductance GaeroW [m/s] set as
  a parameter.
- Nullify pointers explicitly to fix memory leak.

Meteorology: 

BoM AWAP meteorology for Run 26c was downloaded on the following dates

  - Monthly climatology for synthetic series updated from June 2009 data.

Outputs 

- Write new outputs WRel1End, WRel2End, FWWater as noted above.
- Corrected post-processing software error generating erroneous percentile
  ranks for FWPT and SolarMJ.

Ancilliary Data

- Data and maps of the spatial parameters used by AWAP WaterDyn are now
  available at the AWAP website.


12) UPDATES
------------------------------------------------------------------

Updates to the dataset will occur under two circumstances: a new WaterDyn model
or set of parameters; arrival of a reprocessed set of meteorlogical data.

In either case, once the WaterDyn model is deemed stable and the meteorological
data have been verified, new century-long and operational (near-real time)
datasets will be produced.

Formal announcement of updated datasets will be via the website and by email to
the project partners.
